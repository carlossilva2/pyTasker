# Tasker

[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/pytasker/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/pytasker)
[![Supported Versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/pytasker.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/pytasker)

You know [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible) right? Well, this works kind of the same way, except you create tasks to automate your local computer.

How? You're in luck. Just create an InstructionSet (you can use the CLI command `tasker create` to get started) and let your life get easier!

### Actions in Pipeline

- ~~Input Action~~
- Command Action
- Encrypt Action
- Registry Action (for Windows)

### General Improvements
